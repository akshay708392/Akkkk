1. Video Display Devices with Diagram
Video display devices are hardware components used to present graphical content on a screen. There are several types, but the primary ones are:

CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) Displays: These devices use electron beams to light up phosphor dots on a screen, forming images. The image is displayed through a series of raster scan lines.
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display): These use liquid crystals, which align differently when an electric current passes through them to modulate light and create images.
LED (Light Emitting Diode): Similar to LCDs but with LED backlighting, offering better color reproduction and power efficiency.
OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode): Each pixel emits its own light, providing deeper blacks and better contrast.


2. Applications of Computer Graphics
Computer graphics are used in various fields, including:

Entertainment: Video games, animation, movies, etc.
Simulation and Modeling: In engineering, flight simulators, etc.
Medical Imaging: For visualizing scans like CT, MRI, and X-rays.
Design and Drafting: In architecture, product design, etc.
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): For immersive environments.
Education and Training: For interactive visual learning experiences.
3. Difference between Raster Scan and Random Scan Displays
Raster Scan Display:

The screen is divided into a grid of pixels.
Images are drawn pixel by pixel.
CRT monitors typically use raster scan.
Suitable for displaying continuous-tone images like photographs.
Random Scan Display:

Draws directly to the screen from memory as a vector image (lines and shapes).
No fixed pixel grid.
Best for drawing lines and shapes, such as CAD systems.
Generally faster in drawing lines but not suited for detailed images.
4. Color CRT Monitors
Color CRT monitors use the principle of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) to produce a full range of colors:

Electron Gun: The CRT has three electron guns for each color (RGB).
Phosphor Coating: The inside of the screen has phosphor dots coated in three colors (RGB).
Color Mixing: Each electron gun fires electrons at specific phosphor dots to emit corresponding colors.
Refreshing: The screen is refreshed multiple times per second to display continuous images.
5. Clipping Algorithms
Clipping is the process of cutting off the parts of a graphical object that are outside a given boundary (like a viewport). Some popular algorithms include:

Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping: Uses a region code to represent the location of the line relative to the clipping boundary.
Liang-Barsky Line Clipping: Uses parametric equations to efficiently clip lines.
Sutherland-Hodgman Polygon Clipping: Clips polygons against each edge of the clipping window.
6. Circle Generating Algorithms
These algorithms are used to draw circles in computer graphics. Common methods include:

Midpoint Circle Algorithm: An efficient algorithm that determines points on a circle using incremental decisions.
Bresenham's Circle Algorithm: A variant of the midpoint algorithm that uses integer-based calculations for better performance.
7. Two Dimensional Basic Transformations
Basic 2D transformations include:

Translation: Moving an object by adding displacement values to its coordinates.
Scaling: Changing the size of an object by multiplying its coordinates by a scale factor.
Rotation: Rotating an object around a point by a specific angle.
Shearing: Slanting an object along the X or Y axis.
The general procedure involves using transformation matrices and applying matrix multiplication to transform the objectâ€™s coordinates.

8. Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm
The Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to clip lines inside a rectangular clipping window. The basic steps are:

Assign region codes to the line endpoints.
Check if the line is entirely inside or outside the window.
Use bitwise operations to check and clip the line based on its region codes.
9. Basic Three Dimensional Transformations
Basic 3D transformations include:

Translation: Moving an object along the X, Y, and Z axes.
Scaling: Enlarging or shrinking the object in 3D space.
Rotation: Rotating the object around the X, Y, or Z axis.
Shearing: Distorting the object in a non-uniform way.
These transformations are represented using 4x4 matrices and are applied to 3D coordinates.

10. Projection Types in Three Dimensions
There are two main types of projection in 3D:

Perspective Projection: Objects appear smaller as they get farther from the viewer. It mimics the way human vision works.
Parallel Projection: Objects maintain their size and shape, no matter the distance from the viewer. It includes orthogonal projection (where lines remain parallel) and oblique projection (where lines are at an angle).
11. Back Face Detection Method and Depth Buffer Method
Back Face Detection: This method is used in 3D rendering to determine which surfaces of an object are facing away from the viewer and should not be rendered.
Depth Buffer Method: Also called Z-buffering, it stores depth information for each pixel to determine which objects are in front and should be displayed.
12. Depth Sorting Method
In depth sorting, objects are sorted from farthest to closest relative to the viewer. The rendering algorithm then processes objects in this order, drawing the nearest ones on top to prevent them from being occluded by farther objects.

13. A Buffer Method
The A-buffer method is a technique used for anti-aliasing and transparency handling in 3D rendering. It stores information about color and transparency for each pixel and combines the data from overlapping objects to create a smoother visual result.

14. Clipping Operations
Clipping operations are used to remove parts of a graphic that are outside a defined region (like a window or viewport). They are necessary for efficient rendering and involve algorithms like:

Line Clipping (Cohen-Sutherland, Liang-Barsky).
Polygon Clipping (Sutherland-Hodgman).
Point Clipping: Points outside the region are clipped.
Each of these operations ensures only the visible portion of a graphical object is displayed.
